Simple Android app made in Kotlin.

App allows user to create list of random figures (circle, triangle, square). Figure is described by its area and length of a feature (eg. diameter). List can be sorted in both directions. Any element of a list can be duplicated, editted or deleted. User can delete list or add new element to existiong list. Menu allows user to set number of figuers in a list and set range of initial value for figures which is a length of a side or a radius. In statistics user can check number of figures of specific type, total area and value of characteristic.
